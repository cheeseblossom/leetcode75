https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _its maximum depth._

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:

![image](/img/tmp-tree.jpg)

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: 3

---

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,null,2]

Output: 2

---

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {

    }
}
